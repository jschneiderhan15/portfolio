            Hi! I'm Jack Schneiderhan, currently a junior attending the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ. I am pursuing a bachelors of science in computer science, with a minor in visual arts & technology.
            I have a passion for game design and development, taking part in projects that involve both the planning and programming for games. <br>
            Growing up around them, I've had a passion for video games for as long as I can remember. With this history and knowledge of games, I hope to apply myself to the industry and create more games that others
            play and remember just as I do. <br>
            In terms of my career, I am currently looking for an game design / development internship with a games company for the Summer of 2022. <br>
