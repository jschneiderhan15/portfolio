            Oregon Road '83 is the first game I have worked on with a coordinated team. There were approximately 20 of us split between
            three groups: art, programming, and research / design. I worked with the design team for half of the project, and then switched
            to the programming team for the back half of the project. I really enjoyed making this demo as a summer researh project, as it
            gave me a lot of experience working with a team in a game creation setting, along with giving me more Unity experience.'
