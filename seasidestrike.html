            Seaside Strike is my third game from the Udemy course I've been taking over the Summer. It's a simple demo of a tower defense game, but what
            I found most fun about this game was making my own assets. I used the program MagicaVoxel, recommended by the teacher of the course, and I had 
            a great time making my own beach related objects. My favorite part of this game is the voxel art style, as I think it looks very neat and creates
            a cozy world for the player to enjoy.
