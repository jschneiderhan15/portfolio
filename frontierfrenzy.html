            Frontier Frenzy is my second game that I developed in Unity, and it branches out much farther than Sprocket does. This rail shooter takes the player through a
            space environment, shooting down enemy space ships as they go. This game was also developed through a Udemy course, and it builds on the foundation from my
            previous game to make a somewhat more robust experience for the player.
            For more detail on Frontier Frenzy, check out my <a href = "https://github.com/jschneiderhan15" target = "_blank">github</a> for all the files involved. <br>
